# AutoMux
A basic script to remove audio/subtitle tracks from MKV files based on a language "whitelist". Made for use with Cygwin.

## Requires
* [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/)
* [FileBot](https://www.filebot.net/#download) (not strictly necessary, but useful for renaming files after remuxing)

## Usage
Copy the script file into a folder containing MKV files and run `python auto-mux.py`.
